# Doctor Service - Comprehensive Documentation

## üè• Overview

The Doctor Service is a comprehensive microservice that manages all doctor-related information in the Tiny Steps healthcare platform. It handles doctor profiles, qualifications, awards, pricing, practices, and more. This service is built using Spring Boot 3.5.4 with Java 21 and PostgreSQL as the database.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Maven 3.8+
- Running Eureka Service Registry (port 8761)
- Running Auth Service (port 8081)

### Running the Service
```bash
cd doctor-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The service will start on port **8084**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Real-world Usage |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| **Spring Boot Starter Web** | REST API framework | Handles HTTP requests from mobile apps and web clients |
| **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA** | Database operations | Manages doctor data persistence and relationships |
| **PostgreSQL Driver** | Database connectivity | Stores doctor profiles, qualifications, awards, etc. |
| **Spring Boot Starter Security** | Authentication & Authorization | Ensures only authorized users can modify doctor data |
| **Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 Resource Server** | JWT token validation | Validates tokens issued by Auth Service |
| **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Client** | Service discovery | Allows other services to find this service automatically |
| **Flyway** | Database migrations | Manages database schema changes safely |
| **MapStruct** | Object mapping | Converts between DTOs and entities efficiently |
| **Resilience4j** | Circuit breaker, retry, timeout | Handles failures when calling other services gracefully |
| **SpringDoc OpenAPI** | API documentation | Generates interactive API documentation |

### Integration Dependencies

The service integrates with three external services:

1. **User Service** - Validates doctor user accounts
2. **Address Service** - Manages practice locations
3. **Session Service** - Handles session type pricing

## üîê Security Configuration

### Authentication & Authorization

The service uses **JWT-based OAuth2 authentication** with role-based access control:

- **JWT Issuer**: Auth Service (http://localhost:8081)
- **Resource Server**: Validates tokens without storing sessions
- **Roles**: `USER`, `DOCTOR`, `ADMIN`

### Security Rules

| Operation | Required Permission | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Create doctor profile | `USER` role | Any authenticated user can become a doctor |
| View doctor profiles | Public access | Patients can browse doctor profiles |
| Update own profile | Owner or `ADMIN` | Dr. Smith can only edit his own profile |
| Admin operations | `ADMIN` role | Only admins can verify doctors |

### Security Implementation

The `ApplicationSecurityConfig` class implements ownership-based security:

```java
// Example: Only the doctor owner or admin can update awards
@PreAuthorize("@doctorSecurity.isAwardOwner(authentication, #id) or hasRole('ADMIN')")
```

**Real-world scenario**: When Dr. Smith tries to update his award, the system checks if the JWT token's user ID matches the doctor's user ID.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables Overview

The service manages 11 interconnected tables:

```
doctors (main profile)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doctor_awards (achievements)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doctor_qualifications (education)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doctor_memberships (professional memberships)

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Resilience

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
The service uses Resilience4j for handling external service failures:

- **User Service Integration**: 50% failure rate triggers circuit breaker
- **Address Service Integration**: 3 retry attempts with 1-second delay
- **Session Service Integration**: 10-second timeout for requests

### Common Error Responses

| Status Code | Error Type | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid doctor data format |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid JWT token |
| 403 | Forbidden | Trying to edit another doctor's profile |
| 404 | Not Found | Doctor ID doesn't exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Doctor profile already exists for user |
| 500 | Internal Error | Database connection failure |

## üìä Performance & Monitoring

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes**: Created on frequently queried fields (name, speciality, rating)
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination to handle large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Related entities loaded only when needed

### Caching Strategy
- **Profile Data**: Cached for 5 minutes to reduce database load
- **Search Results**: Cached for 2 minutes for popular searches
- **Static Data**: Awards, qualifications cached for 1 hour

## üöÄ Deployment & Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SERVER_PORT` | Service port | 8084 |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` | Database connection | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/doctors` |
| `EUREKA_CLIENT_SERVICE_URL_DEFAULTZONE` | Service registry | `http://localhost:8761/eureka/` |
| `SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_ISSUER_URI` | Auth service | `http://localhost:8081` |

### Health Checks
- **Actuator Endpoints**: `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`
- **Database Health**: Monitors PostgreSQL connection
- **External Service Health**: Checks User, Address, and Session services

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **AI-Powered Matching**: Match patients with best-suited doctors
2. **Telemedicine Integration**: Direct video consultation booking
3. **Multi-language Support**: Doctor profiles in multiple languages
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Doctor performance metrics and insights
5. **Mobile App Integration**: Push notifications for profile updates

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database Sharding**: Split data by geographic regions
- **Microservice Decomposition**: Separate search service for better performance
- **CDN Integration**: Serve doctor photos from content delivery network
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use message queues for profile updates
